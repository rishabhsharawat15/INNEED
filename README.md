# INNEED
INNEED is an ecommerce website that aims to provide products to people in need at the lowest cost possible. They achieve this by selling products that are close to their expiration date but have not yet expired. By doing so, INNEED reduces food waste and offers affordable options to consumers.

By focusing on products that are nearing their expiration date, INNEED can obtain these items from manufacturers, distributors, or retailers who may otherwise discard them. These products are still safe to consume but may not meet the shelf life requirements for regular retail sale. Instead of letting them go to waste, INNEED offers them to consumers at a reduced price.
